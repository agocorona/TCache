        when accessing a resource, the user must provide a partial object for which the key can be obtained.
        for example:

        @data Person= Person{name, surname:: String, account :: Int ....)

        keyResource Person n s ...= n++s@

        the data being accessed must define the fields used by keyResource. For example

         @  readResource Person {name="John", surname= "Adams"}@

        leaving the rest of the fields undefined

        while the database access must be strict, the marshaling must be lazy if, as is often the case,
        some parts of the object are not really accessed.
